#+DESCRIPTION: An emacs presentation

* What is Emacs
  + Emacs is a super extensible programmable "editor"
	- You can write documents, code, agendas, emails, etc.
	- Editor in quotes because it does much more than edit stuff
	  + Tetris is in Emacs by default
	  + Browse the web!
		- I don't really know why you would though, but hey it's there
	  + It can even be your window manager with the package exwm
  + Written in Elisp
	- A dialect of lisp written specifically for Emacs
	- All configurations are done in this language
	  + Example:
		#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
		  (split-window-below)
		  (split-window-right)
		#+END_SRC
		- By default, Emacs does not have a way to go back a "window"
		  + Time to learn some Emacs Jargon!
			- Buffers
			  + Buffers are kind of like tabs in a "regular" editor
			- Windows
			  + These are where buffers can be drawn
			  + Like splitting in vim
			- Frames
			  + These are Emacs instances
			  + What you would normally call a "window"
		    - You really only need to know about buffers and windows
		  + Let's look at some Elisp to do this for us!
			#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
			  (defun go-back-window ()
				(interactive)
				(other-window -1))
			#+END_SRC
		  + Now if we want to bind this function to a key we can!
			#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
			(global-set-key (kbd "C-c u") 'go-back-window)
			#+END_SRC
